# TDD For Dummies
A small repo for small tdd for dummies.

### TDD/BDD - Baby Steps
Steps

1. Make the code fail
	2. Step 1 do this, basically you created your test as commented and run the mocha command to test and it fails, as it should fail.
2. Write the code for a success fallback
	2. Let's create the sum module so it should return 2 as the sum answer.
	3. After step3, we saw that it failed again, because in sum function it was
	defined to return 2 and not the correct sum.
3. After success refactor if necessary.
	1. It's time to refactor our code, and define sum function to do what it's
	supposed to do: sum numbers.
